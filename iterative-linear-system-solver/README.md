# System of linear equation iterative solver

Solve linear system using:

- Jacobi iteration method

- Gauss-Seidel

- LU decomposition

Possibilities (how to make good application programming interface?):

- constructor

- class method

- instance method

- static method (function within class scope)

- public/protected/private

- property

- ...
