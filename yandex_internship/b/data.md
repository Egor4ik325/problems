# Some notes on data structures

Structures for holding data:

Primitive:
- list
- dictionary
- tuple
- set
- class
- named tuple

Complex:
- queue
- dequeue
- linked list
- graph
- tree
- ...


Notes:
- {} == [(,), (,)] (but unordered) - make dictionary from list of tumples
-   - but different use cases (grouping objects vs. relating data about objects)
- list slice[:] == range(,) - slice list using list of indexies (range)
- list.extend(list) vs. list += list
- I have problems not with algorithms but with data (storing, structuring, accessing, modifing, ...)
- Data storing is 1/2 of the algorithm
- Data store/structure: design & working with
- Algorithm design patterns (software design patterns)
- Find right data structure!
- 'string' to [] of chars or dictionary or list of tuples
- {,} vs [(,), (,)] - elements order
